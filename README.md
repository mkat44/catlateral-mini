# Flow
Upon loading the page, a user can choose to destroy items, place them back on the shelves to destroy again later, and even add their own items to destroy in true Catlateral Damage style. 

# Challenges
Handlebars was a bit of a stretch to learn. It's always fun to learn new skills, though!

# Future Goals
Better styling, adding a scoring system, and perhaps remaking the application with React or Javascript+jQuery.
