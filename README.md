# Flow
Upon loading the page, a user can choose to destroy items, place them back on the shelves to destroy again later, and even add their own items to destroy in true Catlateral Damage style. 

# Organization
The application is organized by making an API call to the SQL database to draw items onto the webpage. Dynamic elements are rendered using Handlebars. A user may add objects to the SQL database which then appear on the screen, ready to be destroyed.

# Challenges
Handlebars was a bit of a stretch to learn. It's always fun to learn new skills, though!

# Future Goals
Better styling, adding a scoring system, and perhaps remaking the application with React or Javascript+jQuery.
